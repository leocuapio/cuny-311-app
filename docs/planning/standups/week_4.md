# Standup - Week 4

## What I Completed
- [x] Added gradient card layouts with campus-focused color palette for main categories
- [x] Introduced iconography (react-icons) to improve wayfinding on category selection
- [x] Reworked typography/spacing in the header and multi-step screens for consistent polish

## What I'm Working On
- [ ] Gathering feedback from Leo and Jason on the new visual system
- [ ] Auditing components for accessibility contrast ratios before finalizing colors
- [ ] Preparing content structure so additional form fields can slot in cleanly next week

## Blockers
- Awaiting final brand guidance from Leo to lock the accent colors and icon set

## Learning Goals This Week
- Deepen Tailwind knowledge around gradients, glassmorphism, and responsive spacing utilities

## Notes
- Early student testers reacted positively to the clearer categories; they asked for clearer distinction between safety vs. facilities, which guided the accent updates.

## [OPTIONAL] AI Usage Reflection
- Used AI sparingly to experiment with Tailwind class combinations, but final card layouts were hand-tuned for readability.
