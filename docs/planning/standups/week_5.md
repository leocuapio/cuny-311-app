# Standup - Week 5

## What I Completed
- [x] Expanded every main category with new subcategories (accessibility, sustainability, finance)
- [x] Added contact email capture + anonymous toggle logic with contextual disabling
- [x] Implemented stricter client-side validation (name/email requirements, regex checks, inline error list)

## What I'm Working On
- [ ] Wiring the form to the backend API once Leo finalizes endpoints
- [ ] Drafting empty-state messages for admin tooling so UX stays friendly
- [ ] Pair-testing with Jason to be sure the expanded form still feels lightweight

## Blockers
- Need confirmation on whether non-anonymous submissions must always include email + phone; currently only enforcing email.

## Learning Goals This Week
- Practice structuring form validation helpers that can be reused by the upcoming admin tools.

## Notes
- The validation list dramatically reduced “mystery failures” during testing. Students know exactly what to fix before submitting.

## [OPTIONAL] AI Usage Reflection
- Relied on AI to sanity-check the email regex and craft alternate error copy; final logic verified manually.
